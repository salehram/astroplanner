# AstroPlanner – Feature Roadmap  
*Status: Updated to 2025-12-25*

This document tracks the major features of the AstroPlanner project, what has been completed, and what remains.  
It is intended to be version-controlled in Git for transparency, planning, and future development.

---

## ✅ 1. Treat Each Target as a Project
### Summary  
Originally there was an option to either:
- Treat a target as a top-level object with multiple plans, or  
- Treat every target as its own project.

### Final Decision  
**Each target = one project.**

### Completed
- Added `created_at` to the `Target` model.
- Displayed creation date/time (converted to local timezone).
- Shown on both:
  - Target detail page  
  - Index page  
- Improved visibility using `text-light` + highlighted timestamp.

### Remaining  
Nothing. Feature fully implemented.

---

## ✅ 2. Local Time Zone Handling
### Completed
- Introduced `get_local_tz()` with robust Windows-friendly fallback.
- All timestamps (including created time) now correctly convert:
  - From UTC → Local (UTC+3 by default).
- Eliminated reliance on `tzdata` on systems where it's absent.
- Improved visibility styling.

### Remaining
- Optional: explicitly label sunset/dark/meridian times as “Local Time”.

---

## ✅ 3. Database Rebuild Support
### Completed
- Schema updated with new `created_at` field.
- Provided CLI command `flask --app app.py init-db`.
- Database recreated and validated.

### Remaining  
None.

---

## ✅ 4. NINA Export – Option A (Remaining Subs)
### Completed
- NINA JSON template parsed successfully.
- Dynamic block generation for:
  - Cooling camera  
  - Filter changes  
  - Wait instructions  
  - Exposure sequences  
  - Parking telescope  
- Correct mapping of filter names → wheel positions.
- Export now produces a fully functional NINA Advanced Sequencer JSON.

### Remaining (optional future enhancements)
- Export full plan (not only remaining subs).
- Allow template customization in-app.
- Store multiple export templates.

---

## ✅ 5. Global & Per-Target Configuration (Completed)
### Required
- Global defaults for:
  - Pack-up time
  - Minimum altitude
  - Observer location (lat/lon/elevation)
  - Timezone (fallback to UTC+3)
- Per-target overrides.
- Recompute all dependent information when changed:
  - Window start/end  
  - Midpoint altitude  
  - Chart  
  - NINA export  
  - Status badges  

### Completed
- Added `GlobalConfig` database model with observer location, default settings, and timezone.
- Added `override_packup_time` and `override_min_altitude` fields to `Target` model.
- Created global settings UI at `/settings` with configuration management.
- Created per-target settings UI at `/target/<id>/settings` for overrides.
- Implemented configuration resolution logic with helper functions.
- Updated all window calculations to use configurable parameters instead of hardcoded values.
- Added navigation links in navbar and target detail pages.
- Database initialization automatically creates default global configuration.
- All existing features (window calculations, charts, NINA export) now use configured settings.

### Status  
**✅ Fully implemented and working.**

---

## ✅ 6. Palette Management System (Completed)
### Summary  
Database-driven palette management system allowing custom palettes beyond the hardcoded SHO/HOO/LRGB/LRGBNB options.

### Completed
- **Database Model**: Created `Palette` table with full palette definitions in JSON format
- **Database Schema Updates**: 
  - Added `palette_id` foreign key to `Target` and `TargetPlan` models
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing `preferred_palette` and `palette_name` string fields
- **Default Palettes**: Automatically initialized system palettes (SHO, HOO, LRGB, LRGBNB) with detailed filter configurations
- **Palette Management UI**:
  - List view showing all available palettes (system and custom)
  - Create new custom palettes with dynamic filter channel configuration
  - Edit existing custom palettes (system palettes are read-only)
  - Delete custom palettes (with safety checks for usage)
  - Navigation integration in main navbar
- **Integration**: Updated target creation and editing forms to use database palettes instead of hardcoded options
- **Filter Configuration**: Each palette stores detailed filter information including:
  - Filter names, labels, and descriptions
  - RGB channel mappings
  - Default exposure times and weights
  - Custom channel configurations

### Technical Implementation
- Palettes stored as JSON in database for maximum flexibility
- Backward compatibility maintained during transition

## ✅ 10. Enhanced Imaging Progress & Custom Filter System (Completed)
### Summary  
Major enhancements to the imaging progress tracking system, including automated filter selection from target plans and comprehensive custom filter functionality with real-time calculations.

### Completed Features

#### 10.1 Automated Filter Selection
- **Auto-populated Dropdown**: When adding imaging progress, filter dropdown automatically populates with all filters from the current target plan
- **Seamless Integration**: No more manual filter entry - filters are pulled directly from the active target plan
- **Dynamic Updates**: Filter list updates automatically when plan changes are made

#### 10.2 Custom Filter Addition System
- **Interactive Custom Filter Form**: Complete form interface for adding custom filters not in the original plan
- **Real-time Bidirectional Calculations**: 
  - Enter any 2 of: planned minutes, sub exposure time, or frame count
  - Third value automatically calculates in real-time
  - Supports decimal precision for sub-exposure times (e.g., 0.14 seconds for HDR imaging)
- **Comprehensive Input Validation**: Form validation with proper decimal support and range checking
- **Auto-save Functionality**: Adding a custom filter automatically saves the plan without requiring separate "Save Plan" action
- **Weight Configuration**: Custom weight settings for advanced planning scenarios

#### 10.3 Enhanced User Experience
- **Collapsible Interface**: Custom filter form is collapsible to save screen space when not needed
- **Visual Contrast**: Improved button styling with better color contrast for visibility
- **Progress Notes Display**: Fixed note visibility in imaging progress log with proper color contrast
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Single-click custom filter addition with automatic form submission

#### 10.4 Technical Improvements
- **Decimal Precision Support**: Full support for decimal sub-exposure times throughout the system
- **JavaScript Error Resolution**: Fixed variable redeclaration conflicts in calculation functions
- **Backend Decimal Handling**: Updated progress routes to handle float values instead of integer-only
- **Frame Count Preservation**: Custom filter calculations preserve user-specified frame counts
- **Deletion Handling**: Proper marking and removal of custom filters from plans

#### 10.5 Data Integrity & Calculations
- **Bidirectional Input Sync**: Minutes ↔ exposure time ↔ frame count calculations work seamlessly
- **Plan Consistency**: Custom filters integrate with existing plan structure and calculations
- **Real-time Updates**: All plan calculations update immediately when custom filters are added
- **Database Compatibility**: Custom filter data stored consistently with existing plan structure

### 10.6 NINA Export Compatibility & Filter Mapping
- **Custom Filter Mapping**: Custom filters can be mapped to standard NINA filter wheel names for hardware compatibility

- **Filter Dropdown Integration**: Custom filter form includes NINA filter mapping selection with all standard filter names
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing filters and custom filters without mapping continue to work normally
- **Hardware Integration**: Seamless telescope filter wheel operation with custom filter workflows

### 10.7 Form Validation & Auto-Save Optimization
- **Selective Auto-Save Behavior**: Auto-save only applies to custom filter addition, not plan table modifications
- **Manual Plan Saving**: Plan table changes require explicit "Save Plan" button for user control
- **HTML5 Validation Fixes**: Resolved form validation blocking issues with hidden required fields
- **User Experience**: Improved save behavior prevents unwanted auto-save while maintaining custom filter convenience
- **Form Error Resolution**: Fixed validation conflicts that prevented legitimate form submissions

### 10.8 UI Enhancements & Table Organization
